<p>O primeiro passo para realizar o processamento do arquivo, assim como os
demais arquivos .csv, é a leitura. A função de leitura recebe dois argumentos,
sendo que o segundo é opcional. Tendo lido o arquivo, é possível recuperar
a versão em que o modelo foi executado.</p>

<p>A tabela de informações é fornecida como um dataframe, onde os nomes das colunas geralmente
remetem aos nomes originais das colunas do arquivo .csv, porém em camelCase.</p>

<p>A partir deste dataframe é possível realizar análises e produzir visualizações. Por exemplo,
utilizando o módulo plotly. Deste ponto em diante, não é mais necessário o conhecimento
específico do arquivo ou da idecomp.</p>
